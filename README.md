    engineer_pitcher_features,
    engineer_hitter_features,
    engineer_umpire_features,
    engineer_team_game_features,
    predict_match,
)

# Step 1: Ingest recent data
df = ingest_recent(days_back=3)

# Step 2: Build features
engineer_pitcher_features(df)
engineer_hitter_features(df)
engineer_umpire_features(df)
engineer_team_game_features(df)

# Step 3: Predict a matchup
result = predict_match("NYY", "BOS")
print(result)
```

See `mlb/README.md` for detailed documentation.

## Confidence Engine

All predictions use the core `confidence_score()` and `bet_recommendation()` functions from `core/confidence_engine.py`:

- **Edge Calculation**: Model value minus market value
- **Volatility Tuning**: Sport-specific volatility parameters (baseball: 0.65, basketball: 0.35-0.40, soccer: 0.45-0.55)
- **Sharp/Market Alignment**: Consensus data integration
- **Recommendations**: STRONG BET (>75), BET (60-75), PASS (<60)

## Historical Storage & Analysis

All predictions are automatically stored in a SQLite database (`multisport_history.db`) for tracking and analysis.

### Querying Historical Predictions

```python
from core import get_predictions, get_prediction_summary, export_predictions_to_json

# Get all basketball predictions
bball_preds = get_predictions(sport="basketball")

# Get predictions for a specific team
team_preds = get_predictions(home_team="FC Barcelona")

# Get predictions by date range
recent_preds = get_predictions(
    start_date="2026-06-01",
    end_date="2026-06-30"
)

# Get summary statistics
summary = get_prediction_summary()
print(f"Total predictions: {summary['total_predictions']}")
print(f"Average confidence: {summary['avg_confidence']}%")

# Export to JSON
export_predictions_to_json("output/all_predictions.json")
```

### Database Schema

The predictions table includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `sport`: Sport type (basketball, soccer, mlb, kbo)
- `home_team`, `away_team`: Team names
- `market_type`: Type of market (spread, total, moneyline, props)
- `model_value`: Model's projected value
- `market_value`: Market line/value
- `edge`: Difference between model and market
- `confidence`: Confidence score (0-100)
- `recommendation`: Bet recommendation (STRONG BET, BET, PASS)
- `timestamp`: When the prediction was made
- `raw_json`: Full prediction result
- `result_outcome`: Actual outcome (win, loss, push)
- `profit_loss`: P&L tracking

## Auto-Dispatcher

The `models/auto_dispatcher.py` provides automated prediction dispatching:

- Auto-creates missing CSV files
- Fetches live odds (if ODDS_API_KEY configured)
- Caches results for performance
- Falls back to sensible defaults when data unavailable
- Supports batch prediction across all sports

```bash
# Predict all upcoming matches across all sports
python predict_match.py --batch

# Predict upcoming matches for a specific sport
python predict_match.py --upcoming --league epl
```

## 2026 Season Notes

### MLB
The 2026 MLB season features the new Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System, resulting in:
- Tighter strike zone (53.5% at top, 27% at bottom)
- Average of 9.4 runs per game
- Specific umpire tendencies affecting Over/Under trends

### KBO
- Higher scoring environment (~10.2 runs/game vs MLB's ~8.8)
- Foreign player restrictions (3-player limit with significant impact)
- Unique park factors (Gocheok Sky Dome suppresses HRs)
- Contact-focused league (lowest SwStr% in professional baseball)

### Taiwan P. League+
- 40-minute FIBA rules format
- Fubon Braves are back-to-back defending champions
- Moderate scoring environment (~170-175 total points per game)
